## Redundant Access

**Description**
Adversaries may use more than one remote access tool with varying command and control protocols as a hedge against detection. If one type of tool is detected and blocked or removed as a response but the organization did not gain a full understanding of the adversary's tools and access, then the adversary will be able to retain access to the network.

**Assumptions**
Linux/macOS/Windows Platform, Administrator/User/SYSTEM Permissions Required

**Execution**
Remote Teamviewer Access

**Detection Filter**
