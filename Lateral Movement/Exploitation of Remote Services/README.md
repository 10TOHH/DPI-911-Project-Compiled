# Technique Description
## Exploitation of Remote Services - T1210
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/)
<blockquote>
Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.
